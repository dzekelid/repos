  description: |-
    Identical to `GET /repositories/{username}/{repo_slug}/commits`,
    except that POST allows clients to place the include and exclude
    parameters in the request body to avoid URL length issues.

    **Note that this resource does NOT support new commit creation.**

- name: Bitbucket Get Repositories Username Repo Slug Diff Spec
  description: |-
    Produces a raw, git-style diff for either a single commit (diffed
    against its first parent), or a revspec of 2 commits (e.g.
    `3a8b42..9ff173` where the first commit represents the source and the
    second commit the destination).

    In case of the latter (diffing a revspec), a 3-way diff, or merge diff,
    is computed. This shows the changes introduced by the left branch
    (`3a8b42` in our example) as compared againt the right branch
    (`9ff173`).

    This is equivalent to merging the left branch into the right branch and
    then computing the diff of the merge commit against its first parent
    (the right branch). This follows the same behavior as pull requests
    that also show this style of 3-way, or merge diff.

    While similar to patches, diffs:

    * Don't have a commit header (username, commit message, etc)
    * Support the optional `path=foo/bar.py` query param to filter
      the diff to just that one file diff

    The raw diff is returned as-is, in whatever encoding the files in the
    repository use. It is not decoded into unicode. As such, the
    content-type is `text/plain`.
